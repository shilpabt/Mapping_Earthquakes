# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

* The objective of this challenge is to display GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website on the world map using js, d3, leaflet and Mapbox.
* Multiple layers of maps are created so that users can choose the layer they want to see on the map like Streets, Satellite or Dark.  
* Above the base layers, GeoJSON data of tectonic plates, all earthquakes and all major earthquakes of greater than 4.5 magnitude are plotted. Users have a choice to choose them on any base layers.
* Popup markers are added to show the exact place and the magnitude of the earthquake. Each earthquake is represented by a circle. Styling is applied to show the difference in magnitude of the earthquake. Corresponding legend information is displayed on the right corner of the map.

The final map shows the following,
* The tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.
* Major Earthquake Data.
* Third map style(dark) on earthquake map.
